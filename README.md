# Algorithm Code Test in Swift

Here you'll find implementations of algorithms code test and data structures in Swift
Most of Code will competible with current Swift version

## Caution

I don't have good documentation on code ,most of this code was done in limited time ,
so i am not bother myself to write documentation.

## Important

I am not affiliate with website that provide algorithm code test.I just want to share some thought about some code test


## Contribution

Don't hestitate to contribute on more efficient code , i love to hear something cool from you or 
if you find something interesting on why i come up with this type of code , just ask me on [issue](https://github.com/wendyliga/algorithm-code-test/issues)
